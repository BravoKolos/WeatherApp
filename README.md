Project info:
Weather app using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The app will fetch current weather information from an API based on the user input i.e. city name. 

Objectives:
  - DOM manupulation
  - Creating a responsive design
  - JS functions and API calls

[//]: # (
It would be worth to add a section describing how to set up your app. 
It should contain a link to weather API docs describing where to get the API token from. and then where the key shoudld be pasted. 
It's also worth commiting the config.js file without the real key, but with a comment that this is the place to paste the key to.
)

[//]: # (Concider adding a screenshot of the app so that reviewers would see it without setting up the app. Bonus points if it's a gif showing the app in action.)
